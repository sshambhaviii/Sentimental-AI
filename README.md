# Sentimental AI
#### Summer project offered by Brain and Cognitive Society, IIT Kanpur.
#### Project Mentors: Sahil Bansal, Hitesh Anand, Shaswat Gupta

## Overview
This project focuses on the very fundamentals of Sentiment Analysis using Natural Language Processing. Used standard packages and libraries.
Main Topics covered and timeline:

1. Week 1: Basics of ML and DL
2. Week 2: Basics of ML and DL
3. Week 3: CNNs, RNNs, and LSTMs
4. Week 4: Train RNNs and LSTMs 
5. Week 5: Transformers
6. Week 6: Implementing emoji classifier
7. Week 7: Implementing emoji classifier

## Assignment 1
Implement a Neural Network from scratch. The goal is to use NumPy to make the Neural Network. 

## Assignment 2
The goal of this assignment was to generate Shakespeare text using Long Short Term Memory Models and Recurrent Neural Networks.

## Assignment 3
The assignment focuses on detecting emotion in the text. Implement a research paper- https://thesai.org/Downloads/Volume10No6/Paper_45-Emotion_Detection_in_Text.pdf This paper describes 2 LSTM networks to detect emotions from text- a vanilla LSTM and a nested LSTM out of which any one can be implemented. The primary task was to tweak the architecture described in the paper (changing hyperparameters, number of layers/units etc.) to achieve highest validation accuracy. 
Dataset used : huggingface tweet emotion dataset. It has about 16k tweets classified into 6 emotions for training.
