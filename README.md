# Sentimental AI
#### Summer project offered by Brain and Cognitive Society, IIT Kanpur.
#### Project Mentors: Sahil Bansal, Hitesh Anand, Shaswat Gupta

## Overview
This project focuses on the very fundamentals of Sentiment Analysis using Natural Language Processing. Used standard packages and libraries.
Main Topics covered and timeline:

1. Week 1: Basics of ML and DL
2. Week 2: Basics of ML and DL
3. Week 3: CNNs, RNNs, and LSTMs
4. Week 4: Train RNNs and LSTMs 
5. Week 5: Transformers
6. Week 6: Implementing emoji classifier
7. Week 7: Implementing emoji classifier

## Assignment 1
Implement a Neural Network from scratch. The goal is to use NumPy to make the Neural Network. Additional theory is covered in the ipynb notebook.

The goal of this assignment was to generate Shakespeare text using Long Short Term Memory Models and Recurrent Neural Networks.

## Assignment 3
The assignment focuses on detecting emotion in the text. Implement a research paper- https://thesai.org/Downloads/Volume10No6/Paper_45-Emotion_Detection_in_Text.pdf This paper describes 2 LSTM networks to detect emotions from text- a vanilla LSTM and a nested LSTM. 

Choose any network and implement it. The primary task is to tweak the architecture described in the paper (changing hyperparameters, number of layers/units etc.) to achieve highest validation accuracy. 
Dataset: we will use huggingface tweet emotion dataset. It has about 16k tweets classified into 6 emotions for training.
